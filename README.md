## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

1. **Clone or Download** the project files to your local machine.
2. **Open the project folder** in your preferred code editor (e.g., VS Code).
3. **To enable GPS/Location Features**: 
  - Browsers often block Geolocation requests from raw `file://` URLs. 
  - For the "Get Directions" feature to work perfectly, launch the project using a local server (like the **Live Server** extension in VS Code).
4. Navigate to the local URL (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`) and enjoy the dashboard!

## 📌 Note on Map Directions
When clicking **"Get Directions"**, the browser will ask for Location Access. 
- If you click **Allow**, it will open a new Google Maps tab routing you from your current location to the selected UIU campus destination.
- If you click **Block** or location is unavailable, it will safely fall back to searching the destination directly on Google Maps.
